# lifxmindwave

Mashup of two features Lifx and Mindwave. 
This creates a view of EEG signals via Mindwave measurements and visualizes this in the real world trough Lifx light bulbs.

This was a quick and dirty solution that works, I do not give any guarantees if this will work for you and or will damage any soft or hardware.
